Plotting Audio on a Spiral

Make sure you have Matlab installed, that should be the only dependecy though!

## Inspiration

Recently I have been wanting to build a vinyl lathe, and I was curious about other  physical representations of audio, and having used Matlab a lot this last year, I figured I'd see if I can plot audio waveforms on a spiral, similar to other art I've seen! Ultimately the goal would be to draw the spiral using my Axidraw or something similar!
